# Data Visualization Projects

In this repository, I upload all my data visualization projects

## **1. Tata Data Visualisation**

Empowering Business with Effective Insights Job
Simulation on Forage - March 2024

 In this project I created visuals for data analysis to help executives with effective decision making with the help of forage using sales data of Tata company in the year 2011. 

 The tableau dahsboard consist of 4 visualization metrics. A bar graph that compares the revenue and quantity of product sales of top 10 countries, a visual map highlighting the revenue of each country when your hover on it, a horizaontal bar chart showing the list of top 10 customers based on their revenue ordered in descending order and a line graph showing the revenue by month for the year 2011.

Please find the link for Tableau public of this current project. I could'nt upload my twbx file because of its huge volume

## **2. Bundesliga player analysis dashboard**

This is my personal Tableau dashboard project analysing the players of Bundesliga.
I have used the bundesliga_player.csv file for this project which I opted from Kaggle.com
The dahsboard can be used to analyse the trends in Bundesliga Players especially to look at,
1. Number of Players from each country that participated in the league
2. Most famous Player Agents
3. Contract details of Players by Club
4. Age distribution of Players by Club
5. Trends in Investment on Players by each club
6. Distribution of Players by Positions by each club.

All these trends can be observed according to the desired club by using the interactive filter of Club name, Year in which the contract expires and No.of Players in the dashboard.

You can directly find the twbx file of the dashboard in this repo.

## **3. Dashboard for DataScience job trends across the world**

This is a project to analyze job trends across the world in the field of datascience. This is an interactive dashbaord which I published in Tableau public. You can select a location from dropdown menu and a job title. Accordingly,you can find Average Salary in USD by Experience Level and Employment Type ( entry level, executive, intermediate and senior level ),  pie charts showing 1. share of companies by their size in the selected loaction 2. Share of experience level in that particular job and that particular location 3. share of employment type (i.e part time or full time ) , a distributed bar graph with top 10 employee residences, a map highlighting density of average salary across different locations for selecetd job title, and finally a table showing Average Salary by Job Title and Experience Level.

This is a snippet of how the dashboard looks. Further the dashboard can be found at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/krishna.chaitanya.ginne/viz/DashBoardfroDataScienceJobTrendsacrosstheWorld/Dashboard1

## **4. Predicting book popularity - A datacamp competition**

This is my project workbook created as a part of datacamp competiton that I participated in. 

As reading trends keep changing, an ambitious online bookstore has seen a boost in popularity following an intense marketing campaign. Excited to keep the momentum going, the bookstore has kicked off a challenge among their data scientists. The team is all set to tackle this challenge, aiming to build a model that accurately predicts book popularity, which will help the bookstore manage their stock better and tweak their marketing plans to suit what their readers love the most.

I have used this case to create a prediction model which predicts popular books wiht 85% accuracy.

Process - First I visualized all the necessary coulmns, remove null values and check for duplicated data. Further I proceeded with feature engineering. Finally I decided to used Gradient boost. Gradient boosting models like XGBoost and LightGBM handle both numerical and categorical features well. These models can provide insights into feature importance, helping you understand which features most influence the popularity prediction. Gradient boosting models are known for their high performance on a wide range of tasks, often outperforming other models. They offer a variety of hyperparameters that can be tuned for optimal performance. Our model seems to perform very well with ROC-AUC Score of 0.85

Further, I noticed an imbalance in the classes (more unpopular books than popular ones). Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or class weighting can help improve recall for the minority class. I also performed fine-tuning of hyperparameters using Grid Search or Random Search could improve performance.
